# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Money::Currency.all.sort_by(&:name).each { |currency| Currency.where(iso: currency.iso_code, name: currency.name).first_or_create }
